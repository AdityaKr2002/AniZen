## 📖 About AniZen

AniZen is a solo-built passion project that started on the foundation of Aniyomi and Anikku. It was created to explore how far an Android media client can go when designed with modern programming principles, deep player optimizations, and a focus on fluidity. 

It aims to offer a premium, responsive, and completely personalized viewing space while remaining lightweight and respectful of hardware resources.

## Features

<div align="left">

### Features include:

* **AniZen**:
  * **🎬 Media Player & Video Engine**:
    * `Anime4K Neural Shaders` built-in upscaling quality levels (Fast, Balanced, High) and multiple processing modes (A, B, C, A+, B+, C+) for real-time video upscaling.
    * `Motion Interpolation` temporal interpolation scaling (oversample, mitchell, catmull-rom) generating smooth frames matching the display refresh rate (up to 120fps/144fps).
    * `MPVFX Filter Suite` card-based interface in the player for Debanding, Video Adjustments (Brightness, Saturation, Contrast, Gamma, Hue, Sharpen), and integrated Anime4K controls.
    * `Dynamic Mediacodec Switching` automatic fallback to software decoding if active filters exceed hardware capability.
    * `Adaptive Shader Scaling` automatically downgrades Anime4K quality if high frame drops/delayed frames are detected during playback to keep rendering smooth.
    * `AniSkip Integration` skippable intros and Netflix-style skip button based on the online AniSkip database.
    * `Filler Episode Skipping` automatically skips filler episodes based on tracking information.
    * `Native Picture-in-Picture (PiP)` background playback support with custom controls.
    * `Advanced Config & Script Editor` in-app code editor for `mpv.conf` and `input.conf` files, and support for running custom scripts.
    * `Pinch-to-Zoom Gesture` pinch gestures and precise scale control (up to 3x) with dedicated zoom sheet adjustments during playback.
    * `On-Demand Subtitles` loading of external/custom local subtitle files directly into the active player session via URI.
    * `Default Stream Memory` automatically remembers preferred stream hoster and quality per anime to fast-forward selection for subsequent episodes.
    * `Fluid Playback Gestures` long-press to activate jitter-free 2x speed with release animation, and horizontal slide speed adjustments.
    * `Volume Boosting & Pitch Correction` volume boosting up to 200% with pitch correction to preserve original voices at high speeds.
    * `Custom Aspect Ratios & Sleep Timer` define custom aspect ratio values and schedule playback sleep timers.
    * `Custom Player Layout` fully configurable action buttons and player interface layout reordering.
  * **📥 Resilient Downloader & Storage**:
    * `1DM-Style Downloader` multi-threaded chunked download engine utilizing byte-range splitting.
    * `Resilient Part-File Recovery` per-part file size verification, automatic 5x retry logic with exponential backoff, and robust `BufferPool` recycling.
    * `External Downloader Handoff` seamless delegation of downloads to external managers (like 1DM or ADM), automatically passing custom stream headers, filenames, and download directories.
    * `Native HLS & DASH Engines` multi-threaded HLS segment downloader with on-the-fly AES-128 decryption, variant playlist resolution, and native DASH muxing via FFmpeg with duration-based progress estimation.
    * `Pro-Active Stream Pre-fetching` background stream URL resolution for queued downloads, minimizing delay between transitions.
    * `Pre-Flight Storage Protection` automatic space allocation checks (maintaining a 200MB safety buffer, or 1.5x for FFmpeg operations) before download execution to prevent system instability.
    * `Early Soft Subtitles Retrieval` downloads and packages VTT, ASS, and SRT subtitle tracks automatically and non-fatally alongside the video file.
    * `Atomic Directory Assembly` downloads are isolated in a sandbox cache using temporary folder renames (`_tmp`) to prevent partial downloads from cluttering public storage.
    * `Preload Next Episode` pre-resolves stream links and hoster lists in the background with network-aware throttling to prevent playback stutter.
  * **📰 Feed & Personalization**:
    * `Category-Styled Feeds` feed homepage organizes saved searches and popular content under custom category sections with drag-and-drop ordering.
    * `Saved Search Feeds` pins specific keyword queries and filter configurations directly as auto-updating feed rows.
    * `Unified Feed Tab` view the latest entries or saved searches from multiple sources simultaneously.
    * `Custom Cover Art` set custom covers using local files or web URLs.
    * `Auto theme color` based on each entry's cover for entry View.
    * `Dynamic Player Theme` automatically themes the media player interface colors based on the active cover art.
    * `App custom theme` with `22 Color palettes` for endless customization.
    * `Panorama cover` showing wide cover in full.
    * `Library Folders` group specific anime into custom collapsible sub-folders inside library categories.
    * `UI Container Styles` choose card-like container layouts per-tab (Library, Updates, History, Browse, Details, Settings).
    * `Haze Glassmorphism` toggleable glass-blur styling effects for top and bottom navigation bars.
  * **📊 Statistics & Maintenance**:
    * `Behavioral Watch Statistics` tracks rich watch habits (weekly heatmaps, genre affinity, status breakdowns, rolling 30-day feed activity logs, preferred viewing times, and top-viewed titles) and infrastructure metrics (throughput distribution, latency matrices, and topology breakdowns).
    * `Extension Health Monitoring` live reports detailing extension latency, online node status, and connections metrics.
    * `AI Diagnostics & Assistant` conversational troubleshooting assistant capable of digesting exception trace logs and library context.
    * `Unified Rating Distribution` calculates and displays score distributions and mean ratings by combining local ratings and synced tracker data.
    * `Extension Repository Source Mapping` resolves and tracks the specific GitHub repository (owner/repo) from which extensions are installed.
    * `Diagnostics Report Export` formats and exports extension health statistics, resolve statuses, and logs directly to the clipboard.
    * `Adaptive Navigation` suggests layout presets (Default, Minimal, Power) dynamically based on network connectivity and time-of-day.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

AniZen follows **Clean Architecture** principles to separate business logic, UI, and data handling into a modular structure:

```
app                   # Entry point, dependency injection configuration
├── core              # Shared helpers, common extensions, and base utilities
├── data              # Repositories, database (SQLDelight), and networking (OkHttp)
├── domain            # Core business logic, use cases, and domain models
├── presentation-core # Reusable UI components, themes, and design tokens (Compose)
├── source-api        # Extension API interfaces and definitions
└── source-local      # Local storage and media indexers
```

### Technical Stack & Decisions
*   **Development Platform:** 100% Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for declarative UI.
*   **Concurrency:** Kotlin Coroutines & Flow for asynchronous tasks and state streaming.
*   **Database:** SQLDelight for compile-time safe SQL queries.
*   **Core Shaders:** High-quality `ewa_lanczossharp` scaling for sharpest anime lines.
*   **Scrolling Performance:** Implements `Precision.INEXACT` cover scaling to delegate image processing to the GPU, removing micro-stutter and keeping scrolling fluid on 120/144Hz displays.
